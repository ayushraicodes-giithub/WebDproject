# WebDproject
This is my first projest on GITHUB and I have used CSS, HTML and very small part of Javascript(Just to make the login page functional).
I have created a website where user can write  reviews of different tech gadgets,software and other thing which makes it helpful for others to know the real pros and cons rather than watching paid reviews on youtube. 
Will make it completely functional once I learn backend.
